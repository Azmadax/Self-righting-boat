# Self-Righting Boat

This project explores the optimized design of self-righting boats, including the development of mathematical models and software tools to support this endeavor.

---

## üìú Context

Most ships lack the ability to self-right, making them vulnerable to capsizing under the influence of large waves and propulsion forces. Smaller and faster ships, in particular, are at higher risk.

While rescue boats and some sailing ships (equipped with heavy keels) are designed to self-right, other types of vessels, such as kiteboats, could benefit significantly from this capability. Kiteboats, subjected to strong pulling forces from kites, lack long, heavy keels and thus present unique design challenges.

This project aims to address these challenges and contribute to the safety and reliability of kiteboats and similar vessels.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation
You can download the code directly from GitHub or using git:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Azmadax/self-righting-boat.git
```

To install the required dependencies, follow the steps below:

1. Install `uv` by following the official [installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation).
2. Alternatively, run the command from root of repository:  
   ```bash
   cd self-righting-boat
   make install-uv
   ```

## üöÄ Usage

To launch an example, run the following command from root of repository:  
```bash
uv sync --package hydrostatic
uv run hydrostatic_2d_example.py
```
Alternatively, if you have make install, just run:
```bash
make demo
```

## Test
To launch the complete suite of tests, launch the following command:
```bash
uv sync --package hydrostatic
uv run pytest package/hydrostatic/tests
```
Alternatively, if you have make install, just run:
   ```bash
   make test
   ```
